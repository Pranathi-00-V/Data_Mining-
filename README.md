# Data_Mining

Here are the implementation of few alogorithms that are widely used in data mining.

Apriori is an algorithm that is used for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases.  

Featue selection in machine learning is widely used to extract relevant,important features that are used to build more efficient models.
Filter approach is one of the popular approach that is used in feature selection.It picks up the intrinsic properties of the features measured via univariate statistics 
instead of cross-validation performance. Information gain,Chi-square Test,Fisherâ€™s Score,Correlation Coefficient,Variance Threshold etc are some of the techniques that are used in 
filter approach. Here the implementation of filter approach with variance threshold method has been done.
